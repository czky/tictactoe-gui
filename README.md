# tictactoe-gui
Tic-Tac-Toe, now with GUI. Made with love and `tkinter`

# Short, but adorable presentation of the code
- We create an empty board
- Create the `play_game` function
  - Display the empty board on the screen
  - Create a loop for checking if the game is over or not
  - Flip the player after **the win / the tie**
- Each player can select a position in which they want to place their symbol
- ***"Winners can be made by rows, columns or diagonals"*** - maybe someone in the forgotten history
- That's all

_Beautiful, isn't she?_
